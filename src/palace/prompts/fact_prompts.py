EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a research report. The body of the report will contain some citations to references.

Citations in the main text may appear in the following forms:
1. A segment of text + space + number, for example: "Li Qiang constructed a socioeconomic status index (SES) based on income, education, and occupation, dividing society into 7 levels 15"
2. A segment of text + [number], for example: "Li Qiang constructed a socioeconomic status index (SES) based on income, education, and occupation, dividing society into 7 levels[15]"
3. A segment of text + [number†(some line numbers, etc.)], for example: "Li Qiang constructed a socioeconomic status index (SES) based on income, education, and occupation, dividing society into 7 levels[15†L10][5L23][7†summary]"
4. [Citation Source](Citation Link), for example: "According to [ChinaFile: A Guide to Social Class in Modern China](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/media/guide-social-class-modern-china)'s classification, Chinese society can be divided into nine strata"
5. A segment of text + space + (Author names, year), for example: "Recently, a paper constructed a socioeconomic status index (SES) based on income, education, and occupation. (Chen et al., 2019) or (Chen et. al., 2019)"
6. A segment of text + space + Author names + space + (year), for example: "Recently, a paper constructed a socioeconomic status index (SES) based on income, education, and occupation. Chen et. al. (2019)"

Please identify **all** instances where references are cited in the main text, and extract (fact, ref_idx, url) triplets. When extracting, pay attention to the following:
1. Since these facts will need to be verified later, you may need to look for some context before and after the citation to ensure that the fact is complete and understandable, rather than just a simple phrase or short expression.
2. If a fact cites multiple references, then it should correspond to two triplets: (fact, ref_idx_1, url_1) and (fact, ref_idx_2, url_2).
3. For the third form of citation (i.e., where the citation source and link appear directly in the text), the ref_idx should be uniformly set to 0.
4. If the main text does not specify the exact location of the citation (for example, only the reference list is listed at the end of the article, without specifying the citation point in the text), please return an empty list.
5. If the reference is not exactly in the format specified above, please extract the reference anyway.

You should return a JSON list format, where each item in the list is a triplet, for example:
[
    {{
        "fact": "Text segment from the original document. Note that Chinese quotation marks should use full-width marks. And add a single backslash before the English quotation mark to make it a readable for python json module.",
        "ref_idx": "The index of the cited reference in the reference list for this text segment.",
        "url": "The URL of the cited reference for this text segment (extracted from the reference list at the end of the research report or from the parentheses at the citation point)."
    }}
]

Here is the main text of the research report:
{report_text}

Please begin the extraction now. Output only the JSON list directly, without any chitchat or explanations."""


DEDUPLICATE_PROMPT = """You will be given a list of statements. You need to de-duplicate them and return a list of indices of the unique statements. Note: Two statements are considered duplicates only if they express *exactly the same thing*. If there are no duplicate statements in the list, return the complete list of indices.

You should return a List(int), where each item in the list is the index of a unique, non-duplicated statement that has been retained. For example:
[1, 3, 5]

Below is the list of statements you need to de-duplicate:
{statements}

Please begin the extraction now. Output only the integer list, without any conversational text or explanations."""


VALIDATE_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a reference and some statements. Please determine whether each statement is 'supported', 'unsupported', or 'unknown' with respect to the reference. Please note:
First, assess whether the reference contains any valid content. If the reference contains no valid information, such as a 'page not found' message, then all statements should be considered 'unknown'.
If the reference is valid, for a given statement: if the facts or data it contains can be found entirely or partially within the reference, it is considered 'supported' (data accepts rounding); if all facts and data in the statement cannot be found in the reference, it is considered 'unsupported'.

You should return the result in a JSON list format, where each item in the list contains the statement's index and the judgment result, for example:
[
    {{
        "idx": 1,
        "result": "supported"
    }},
    {{
        "idx": 2,
        "result": "unsupported"

Below are the reference and statements:
<reference>
{reference}
</reference>

<statements>
{statements}
</statements>

Begin the assessment now. Output only the JSON list, without any conversational text or explanations."""
